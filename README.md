 ğŸ“± I love this industry. In the past 10 years, I made numerous Apps and Games both teamed and solo. Having attended a design school and graduated from an art University, I started out as a designer. Later on, I transitioned to App Developer (Web, Flash, then iOS Dev, plus some Unity). Being a knowledge-sharing enthusiast, I maintain a [Dev Blog](https://blog.eppz.eu/).
