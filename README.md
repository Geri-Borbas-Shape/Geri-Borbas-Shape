**About myself:**<br />
👋 Hello people, excited to be here! 📱 I love this industry. In the past 10 years, I made numerous Apps and Games both teamed and solo. Having attended a design school and graduated from an art University, I started out as a designer. Later on, I transitioned to App Developer (Web, Flash, then iOS Dev, plus some Unity). Being a knowledge-sharing enthusiast, I maintain a [Dev Blog].

 🎉 We relocated our Family of three in 2022 with a 5-year-old little girl. 🦄

**How I heard about Shape:**<br />
Multiple ways (Recruiter, Google, Twitter, The Hub)

**Previous work/school:**<br />
🛠️ Before Shape, I've done Remote iOS Dev Consultancy for 7 years. Before that, I was iOS Dev and UI/UX Designer at Budapest agencies for 7 years, before that we ran a small design studio with friends in sync with the University.

**Hobby/interests:**<br />
All things related to Design, Geometry, Architecture, Art plus related development projects.

🏛️ During the lockdowns, I got hooked on Digital Lego so ended up working on this [miniature Acropolis design].

⛩️ I ventured into geometry-related games, created a [tangram!] game and [its sequel], plus created a gesture-based SwiftUI Sudoku game. It is yet to be published, but I can show the [design files]. I'm overly enthusiastic about design systems (an everything in-between design and development).

♠️ Spent time with online poker. I prototyped a [HUD for macOS PokerStars client] to overlay 3rd party player data for better estimating hand ranges.

🎹 Guitar and piano hobbyist.

**Three things I would bring to a deserted island:**<br />
😄 Would not go there in the first place. ⛴️ I guess a big ship with supplies would be sufficient with instructions about how to leave.
